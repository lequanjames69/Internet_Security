A rootkit is a collection of tools (programs) that enable administrator-level access to a computer or computer network. Typically, a cracker installs a rootkit on a computer after first obtaining user-level access, either by exploiting a known vulnerability or cracking a password.
Ransomware: a type of malicious software designed to block access to a computer system until a sum of money is paid.
Tabjacking is a new form of malware that can enter your PC through vulnerabilities in your Web browser that allow hackers to insert malicious code into the tabs of your Web browser. The code is capable of hijacking the tab to a new Web page and inserting advertising pop-ups, worms, trojans, or other malware into your PC
A macro virus is a computer virus that "infects" a Microsoft Word or similar application and causes a sequence of actions to be performed automatically when the application is started or something else triggers it. Macro viruses tend to be surprising but relatively harmless.
A logic bomb is a piece of code intentionally inserted into a software system that will set off a malicious function when specified conditions are met

A keylogger can be either a piece of software or a small hardware device that is used to capture the keystrokes that are typed on the keyboard.
Exploit: a software tool designed to take advantage of a flaw in a computer system, typically for malicious purposes such as installing malware.
Brute force is a trial and error method used by application programs to decode encrypted data such as passwords or Data Encryption Standard keys, through exhaustive effort rather than employing intellectual strategies.

A botnet (also known as a zombie army) is a number of Internet computers that, although their owners are unaware of it, have been set up to forward transmissions (including spam or viruses) to other computers on the Internet.

A back door is a means of access to a computer program that bypasses security mechanisms. A programmer may sometimes install a back door so that the program can be accessed for troubleshooting or other purposes. However, attackers often use back doors that they detect or install themselves, as part of an exploit.
An advanced persistent threat (APT) is a network attack in which an unauthorized person gains access to a network and stays there undetected for a long period of time. The intention of an APT attack is to steal data rather than to cause damage to the network or organization.
